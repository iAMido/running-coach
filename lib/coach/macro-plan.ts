/**
 * The season layer: phases, targets, and the criteria for moving between them.
 *
 * ## Why a macro plan holds no workouts
 *
 * Measured on this app's own output, a plan-week costs ~623 output tokens. An
 * 11-month day-by-day plan is ~30k against a 16k ceiling, so it cannot be
 * generated in one call — but that is the smaller objection. The real one is
 * that a prescribed session for July 2027 is fiction. It will be invalidated by
 * the first real climbing block, an illness, or simply by how the athlete
 * adapts, and a plan that is wrong in its details teaches you to ignore it.
 *
 * So this layer holds **intent and targets**; `training_plans` rows hang off it
 * as 8-16 week blocks carrying actual sessions.
 *
 * ## Exit criteria are the point
 *
 * Each phase declares what must be TRUE to leave it, not merely how long it
 * lasts. A phase ends when its criterion is met; if it is not met, the phase
 * extends. That makes the season adaptive by construction rather than by
 * re-prompting a model every few weeks and hoping it stays coherent — and it
 * means a slow adapter gets more base instead of being marched into a build
 * phase he is not ready for.
 *
 * Criteria must be checkable against `TrainingState`. A criterion nothing can
 * measure is a wish, and this codebase has enough of those recorded already.
